    "description" : "The PnP.Maxtools package is a set of objects designed for the real-time automation of control parameters within MaxMSP. It is a set of filters, sound description tools, audio effects, and other objects that are designed to be used together to compose music or improvise without the use of external controllers or hardware. The PnP.Maxtools package is designed to take incoming audio from a microphone, analyze it, and use the analysis to automate changes to an audio effect on the incoming signal in real-time. Reflexive Automation is the term used to describe this analogous relationship between the audio content and the resulting musical transformations, and it enables control parameters to become more multifaceted and better able to serve the needs of artists.",
